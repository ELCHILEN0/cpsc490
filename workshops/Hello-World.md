# Hello World, compiled

This section is designed to introduce you to C++ - we compile the "simplest program", we run it, we decompile it, we figure out what it actually does.

## Learning objectives
- Introduce ourselves
- (re)Familiarise ourselves with compilation and assembly language

## Preparation

- Bring a "Hello World" with you to the meeting
- Prepare to read assembly
- Prepare your semantic analyser

## Outline

- Present your "Hello World", let's introduce ourselves
- For each variation we have:
    - Compile it
    - Run it
    - Map out its semantics
    - Try to figure out what the assembly the compiler outputs actually does
