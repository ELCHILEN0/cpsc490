Virtual Function logSetup() called from base class constructor.

/**
 * It is an interface class for widgets - widgets should inherit from it
 * and implement its methods.
 */

 Therefore, since it should be defined as an interface, there should not be a constructor calling virtual functions.


 * Shouldnt call write from constructor...
 * fixed by calling superclass constructor


Classes derived from the Drawable interface and the references to the widgets vectors are defined as the Drawable interface, 
the destructors for the actual derived class are undefined from the point of view of the compiler.  Thus adding virtual to 
the destructor allows it to run for polymorphic classes.

FairyStringDrawContext::newLine() was calling the Base StringDrawContext::newLine() which calls its respective write() method 
instead of the overloaded FairyStringDrawContext::write() method.
