Virtual Function logSetup() called from base class constructor.  Thus despite being overwritten, on construction the only matching
method that could be called was Drawable::logSetup() instead of any of its overwritten logSetup methods.  Thus classes inheriting from
Drawable should invoke logSetup().

Classes derived from the Drawable interface and the references to the widgets vectors are defined as the Drawable interface, 
the destructors for the actual derived class are undefined from the point of view of the compiler.  Thus adding virtual to 
the destructor allows it to run for polymorphic classes.

FairyStringDrawContext::newLine() was calling the Base StringDrawContext::newLine() which calls its respective write() method 
instead of the overloaded FairyStringDrawContext::write() method.
