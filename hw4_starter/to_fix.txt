Virtual Function logSetup() called from base class constructor.

/**
 * It is an interface class for widgets - widgets should inherit from it
 * and implement its methods.
 */

 Therefore, since it should be defined as an interface, there should not be a constructor calling virtual functions.


 * Shouldnt call write from constructor...
 * fixed by calling superclass constructor
